Version format
X.Y.Z
X- major Version
Y-minor Version
Z- patch Version

Rules
1. Fixing a bug and the code staying backwards-compatible
you increment the patch version.
Eg. 1.1.1 to 1.1.2

2. When you add new functionailty but the code still stays
backwards-compatible, you increment the minor version.
You also reset the patch version to 0.
Eg. 1.1.1 to 1.2.0

3. Make changes to code and no more backwards-compatibility
major version++ and minor and patch = 0
Eg. 1.1.1 to 2.0.0

Question: what happens if you fix a bug and add a new functionality.
How is the versioning done?

Semantic versioning always starts with 0.1.0

When code is production ready, version++ version 1.0.0
After this even the simplest of changes increases the version number
